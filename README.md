# PirateFlix

PirateFlix is a torrent streaming client for the desktop. It acts as a region-independent and free alternative to NetFlix for those who want to binge watch their favourite movies without being born in the right country or forking over precious cash.

PirateFlix is built on the following libraries:
- *omdb*: a node API for the free oMDB movie database. Movie data is pulled from here.
- *thepiratebay*: a node API for thepiratebay.org. Torrents are fetched from here.
- *peerflix*: a torrent streaming engine for node.

## Roadmap

PirateFlix will be updated with more features in the following weeks, including:
- support for series
- actor searches
- genre searches
